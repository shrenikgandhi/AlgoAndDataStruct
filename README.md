The intent of this repository is to work on algorithm and data structures problem for personal development.

The learning will vary from dynamic programming to some programming problems found on internet.

 - I am starting by referring to the following playlist on YouTube credits [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org)

- [2/2/19] After going through initial 4 videos on YouTube, when I  reached the video on LIS. So instead of watching the video, I decided to solve the problem by myself. Took me a couple of days to come up with an optimal solution but finally I could solve all the test cases here(Try to solve it by yourself and then check the solution):
